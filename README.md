# About the project
This project was created to track ongoing natural disasters such as wildfires, volcano eruptions, and more. With the help of NASA's Events API for storm tracking and Google Map's API for visual plotting and map rendering, this tracker is fully functional and displays current, ongoing natural disasters within the past 30 days. Features of this tracker include live icons, infoboxes with information upon clicking an icon, live links to each event, and more features coming.
